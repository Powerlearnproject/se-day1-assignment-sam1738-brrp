Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering systematically applies engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance hence playing a crucial role in the Tech.industry by enabling creation of software apps and systems that power various aspects


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The 3 Key Milestones in the evolution of software engineering are;
1.Development of Programming Languages
2.Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
3.The advent of structured programming in the 1970's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of Software Development Life Cycle are;
1.Requirements; Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2.Design; Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3.Implementation; Writing code and building software according to design specifications


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Contrast Between;
Waterfall methodologies; Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall

Agile methodologies; Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change

Scrum methodologies;Agile framework emphasizing small, self-organizing teams working in short iterations called sprint


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer
Roles;
1.Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Responsibilities;
1.Implementing Software Solutions

Quality Assurance Engineer
Roles;
1.Ensures software quality
Responsibilities;
1.Executing test plans

Project Manager
Roles;
1.Oversees software projects
Responsibilities;
1.Oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated Development Environments(IDE);
Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and Testing Code
Examples;
1.VS-Code
2.Eclipse


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced by software engineers include;
1.Changing requirements; Requirements may change during development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays
2.Tight Deadlines; Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality
3.Technical Debt; Accrued from shortcuts or sub-optimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs

Strategies for overcoming challenges posed;
1.Unit Testing; Testing individual components or module of a software
2.Integration Testing; Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
3.System Testing; Testing the entire software system as a whole


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering; All about crafting questions or statements to get the possible responses from A.I models.(Think of it as giving clear instructions to a very smart assistant)
Significance of interacting with A.I models
1.Helps us avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the A.I understands exactly what you need


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt;
"Tell me about cats,"

A vague prompt changed to Clear,Specific and Concise;
"Tell me about the History of Domestic Cats"
